In a land of dreams and wonder,
Lived a girl named Alice, oh so tender.
With eyes like stars and a heart so pure,
She embarked on adventures, that's for sure.

In the meadows of green, she met a boy,
Whose name was Peter, full of joy.
Together they danced, hand in hand,
Creating memories, like grains of sand.

In the distance, a voice called out,
It was the enchanting melody of a girl named Scout.
Her voice like honey, sweet and clear,
Filling the air with love and cheer.

And lastly, there was a boy named Max,
With a mischievous grin and a knack for pranks.
He brought laughter and mischief wherever he went,
A true friend, always ready to lend.

In this tale of names and dreams,
These characters shine like sunbeams.
Their stories intertwined, forever to be told,
In the pages of this file, a world unfolds.
